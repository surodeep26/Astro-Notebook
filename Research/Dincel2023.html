            <ul>
                <li>Is the spin down rate \(\dot{P}\) more or less constant for pulsars?</li>
                <h3>Ans:</h3>
                No, usually for single/isolated pulsars, \(\dot{P}\) reduces (slowing down rate becomes slower). Unless, the pulasar is in a binary system. In the binary system, due to acceretion, the spin-rate increases (not sure about \(\dot{P}\) then). <br>
                Also, look at \(P-\dot{P}\) diagram.

This slowing is due to braking caused by the rotating magnetic field. This spin-down rate \(\dot{P}\) can be used to approximate the age of the pulsar, known as the <i>characteristic age \(\tau\)</i> $$\tau=\frac{P}{(n-1)\dot{P}}$$ $$\tau = \frac{P}{2\dot{P}}$$ This characteristic age is an approximation for the acutal age with the following assumptions: <ul><li>Spin period initially was much smaller than today</li><li>No magnetic field decay</li><li>Magnetic braking is by <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Pulsars_and_neutron_stars/Pulsar_properties#Pulse_period:~:text=factor%20of%20two.-,Spin%20down%20energy%20loss%20rate,-%5Bedit%20%7C">energy loss</a> of spinning dipole in perfect vacuum (so braking index \(n=3\))</li></ul></div>spin-down age</div>

            <b>Key Words:</b> OB runaway stars &emsp; Pulsars

            <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>20% of all OB-type stars are runaways <a href="Hoogerwerf2001.html">Hoogerwerf2001</a>.</li>
                <li>If the secondary is ejected above \(25 \text{ km/s}\) in an SN explosion, it becomes a runaway star <a href="Tetzlaff2010.html">Tetzlaff2010.</a></li>
                <li>Their high spcae velocity is explained by two independent mechanisms: BSS and DES.</li>
                <br>
                <b>Binary Supernova Ejection Scenario (BSS):</b><br>
                This describes how a stellar companion of an evolved star can get high space velocities. Here, due to a sudden mass loss of the primary during the SN, the secondary star is unbound from the binary orbit and is catapulted outwards (tangentially?) with its orbital velocity. This happens if more than half of the mass of the binary system is lost in the explosion <a href="Blaauw1961.html">Blaauw1961</a>. <br>
                The asymmetry in the explosion gives a substantial kick to the neutron star <a href="Wongwathanarat2013.html">Wongwathanarat2013</a>, which is confirmed by observations to be \(300-400 \text{ km/s}\). High avg. kinetic energies of the NSs imply that the binary system is disrupted regardless of the amount of the ejected mass. The lack of neutron stars for many OB runaways <a href="Sayer1996.html">Sayer1996</a>,  low rate of X-ray binaries, and the high rate of isolated neutron stars show that binary disruption is likely in most cases <a href="Guseinov2005.html">Guseinov2005</a>.

                <br>
                In some cases, the compact object does not receive a significant kick and/or the majority of the total mass is stored in the secondary through conservative mass transfer. Hence, the compact object remains bound to the companion star <a href="vandenHeuvel1993.html">vandenHeuvel1993</a>. <div class="tooltip"><div class="tooltiptext">like 4U1700-37 (Ankay et al. 2001), Vela X-1 (Kaper et al. 1997), 29 and 4U 2206+54 (Hambaryan et al. 2022) </div>High mass X-ray binaries</div> are such exmaples. 
                <br><br>
                <b>Dynamical Ejection Scenario (DES):</b><br>
                Here, stars are ejected out of their formation cluster due to gravitational instabilities during the early stages of cluster formation and evolution. This can happen when a star/binary system comes close to a binar system. The velocities of the unbound systems thus formed have velocities similar to the BSS runaways since both mechanisms utilize orbital motions on similar scales thus keeping a similar energy scale.
                <br> <br>
                <li>Both scenarios are viable. We don't know yet if one is more viable than the other.</li>
                <li>Runaway-NS pairs are observed here in FSU Jena:  PSR1706−16 - ζ Oph <a href="Neuhäuser2020.html">Neuhäuser2020</a> and PSR J0826+2637 - HIP 13962 <a href="Tetzlaff2014">Tetzlaff2014</a>. Their positions are traced back using 3D Monte Carlo simulations. Uncertainties are high since Sn event took place more than \(10^{5} \text{ yr}\) ago</li>
                <li>OB-type stars evolve fast and so are guaranteed to be young and less in number. This reduces uncertainties when associating them to clusters. They are bright, so observations are easy.</li>
                <li>Massive progenitors tend to have massive companions <a href="Pinsonneault&Stanek2006.html">Pinsonneault&Stanek2006</a>, hence the runaway stars are expected to be mostly O and B type.</li>
                <li>HD37424 was found to be the runaway star which was the companion to the progenitor of PSR J0538+2817 which caused SNR147. Kinematic study shows that both objects were at the same position near the galactic center \(30 \pm 4\text{ kyr}\) ago <a href="Dincel2015.html">Dincel2015</a>.</li>
                <li style="color: brown;">!! OB runaway search inside 12 other SNRs returned an absence of OB-runaways in these SNRs ref. Dincel+2023</li>
                <li>Alternatively, we can search in/near open clusters. Even without the affirmation of flight trajectory of NS coinciding, it is possible to distinguish BSS and DES runaways simply from their ejection time. <br> DES mechanisms are effective in the early ages of open clusters. Clusters older than 3Myr would have gone through their phase of frequent dynamical ejections <a href="Oh&Kroupa2016.html">Oh&Kroupa2016</a>. Therefore, an ejection of a runaway later than this stage would be BSS. <a href="Bhat2022.html">Bhat2022</a> suggested BSS origin of several well studied OB-runaways.</li>
                <li>In this paper, we report an OB-runaway candidate ejected from Berkeley 97 within the last \(26 \text{ kyr}\) due to the supernova of the progenitor of PSR J0538+2817.</li>
                <li>Non-detection of SNR form a core-collapse origin, after a relatively short time period, will be useful to the understanding of SNR evolution</li>

            <h2>2. Berkeley 97 & PSR J2238+5903</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Based on "Updated parameters of 1743 Open Clusters" catalog <a href="??">??</a>, Berkeley 97 is at \(α=22h39m23.98s, δ =+59d00m16.6s\), having a diamter of \(D=5'\). Distance \(d=2485 \pm 110 \text{ pc}\) and \(A_V = 2.539 \pm 0.04 \text{ mag}\). Age is \(\tau = 7.589\pm0.381 \text{ yr}\) with metallicity \([Fe/H] = -0.1\pm0.026\) in solar. Proper Motions: \(\mu_\alpha^* = -2.697\pm0.176 \text{ mas/yr}, \mu_\delta = -1.829\pm0.144 \text{ mas/yr}\). RV measurements not available for the cluster.</li>
                <li>The radio quiet γ−ray pulsar PSR J2238+5903 is located at α =22h38m28.09s δ = +59d03m43.3s <a href="Abdo2009.html">Abdo2009</a> which is 7.9 arcmin away from Berkeley 97 (~ 5.7 pc at a distance of 2485 pc)</li>
                <li>\(P = 162.7 \text{ ms}\) and \(\dot{P} = 9.7034\times 10^{-14} \text{ s/s}\) <a href="Ray2011.html">Ray2011</a></li>
                <li>Spin down age is only \(\tau = 26.6 \text{ kyr}\)</li>
                <li>Dipole magnetic strength \(B = 4.02\times 10^{12} \text{ G}\) <div class="tooltip"><div class="tooltiptext" style="width: 450px;">The <b>minimum magnetic field strength</b> or <b>characteristic magnetic field</b> at the surface of a canonical pulsar is: <br> $$B > \left(\frac{3c^3I}{8\pi R^6}\right)^6 (P\dot{P})^{1/2}$$ substitute the values for a canonical pulsar \(I=10^{45} \text{ g cm^2}\) and \(R=10^6 \text{ cm}\) $$\frac{B}{\text{gauss}}>3.2\times 10^{19} \sqrt{\frac{P\dot{P}}{\text{s}}}$$</div>can be deduced from \(P\dot{P}\)</div>. Distance to the pulsar is \(d = 2.8 \text{ kpc}\) (ATNF Catalog)</li>
                <li>Proper motions are unknown. Despite the young age, it is not linked to any SNR.</li>
                <li>We <b>re-selected</b> the members and fit an isochrone on a CMD based on Gaia DR3.</li>
                <li>The parallax of HD 240016 and HD 240015 are 0.3652±0.0363 and 0.3583±0.0125 mas respectively</li>
                <li>Thus, to match these parallax values of the bright (almost definitely members) stars, we limited the stars of the cluster to have parallax values between 0.3 and 0.4 (and parallax quality > 10) within 2.5 arcmin of the cluster center (since diameter is 5'). This narrows down cluster members to only 25. 24 members among these have avg. pm values \(\mu_\alpha^* = -2.715\pm0.213 \text{ mas/yr}, \mu_\delta = -1.896\pm0.172 \text{ mas/yr}\) where the errors are the standard deviations which corresponds to only 2.6 km/s and 2.1 km/s respectively. This low deviation shows that they have a common proper motion.</li>
                <li>One star, the runaway has significantly different proper motion \(\mu_\alpha^* = -0.379\pm0.025 \text{ mas/yr}, \mu_\delta = -1.352\pm0.024 \text{ mas/yr}\)</li>
                <li>Geometrical distances of the (potential) members are taken from <a href="Bailer-Jones2021.html">Bailer-Jones2021</a>. The avg. of 24 stars is \(r_{geo} = 2733 \text{ pc}\) with \(\sigma = 163 \text{ pc}\) which is consistent with the upper and lower errors of the individual measurements, 160 pc and 170 pc. These stars are listed here:</li>
                <li>The CMD of the 25 stars is fit by theoretical isochrones. These theoretical isochrones were made using CMD 3.7 with 'Parsec 1.2S' stellar evolutionary tracks (Cheng et al. 2015) with bolometric corrections from (Giarardi et al. 2008) and the extinction curve from (Cardelli et al. 1989) and (O'Donnell 1994) for a metallicity of \([Fe/H] = -0.1\) solar and extinction law \(R=3.1\).</li>

            <ul>
                <li>The spectra of the two bright members was taken several times with FLECHAS (Fibre Linked Échelle Astronomical Spectrograph) <a href="Mugrauer2014.html">Mugrauer2014</a> on a 90cm <div class="tooltip"><div class="tooltiptext"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/78/Schmidt_Camera.jpg" width="400px">This type of telescope is good to eliminate abberations.

                <li>...details of the spectra calculation...</li>
                <li>Doppler shift of ISM lines (NaI DI and NAII D2) on the stellar spectra are calculated by Gaussian fitting. Avg. heleocentric radial velocity (by NaI D1 and NaII D2) of HD240015 is \(RV_{Na} = -25.1\pm 1.0 \text{ km/s}\) and HD240016 is \(RV_{Na} = -23.6\pm 3.1 \text{ km/s}\). These are considerably less than the measured heleocentric radial velocity of the stars. This might be due to S/N and dispersion quality of the data.</li>
                <li>The radial velocity for HD240015 is consistent. But for HD240016, it varies a lot (\(-37\) to\(-64 \text{ km/s}\)). This suggests it could be a <div class="tooltip"><div class="tooltiptext">Binary detected by spectroscopy. Not resolved visually.</div>spectroscopic binary system</div>.</li>

Other lines like O II λ 4640 and λ 4650 (blend + C III) are stronger while Mg II λ 4481 is weaker compared to a model with \(T=18,000K\) and \(\log{g}=2.8-3.0\). </li>
                <li>HD240015 shows strong He II λ 4686 equal in strength to He I λ 4713. This means it should have a temperature of around 24000K</li>

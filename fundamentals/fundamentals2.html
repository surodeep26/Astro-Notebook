                    <h2 >Luminosity</h2>
                    <p><b>Luminosity</b> is the intrinsic brightness of an object. It is measured in the units of energy per time or <i>watts</i> (W)</p>
                    <p>For example, the Sun radiates \(4\times10^{26}\)W. Solar parameters are given special units. This amount of luminosity is called solar luminosity and is denoted by \(L_\odot\). $$L_\odot=4\times10^{26}\text{W}$$</p>
                    In astronomy, it is common to use cgs units. \(1\text{W} = 10^7\text{erg s}^{-1}\).
                    $$L_\odot=4\times10^{33}\text{erg s}^{-1}$$
                    The luminosity of our galaxy is about \(10^{11}L_\odot\)
                    <h2>Flux</h2>

                    The amount of radiation received by an observer who is at some distance away from the source of luminosity is the <b>flux</b> received by them.
                    <p>Naturally, this follows an inverse square law (see diagram below).</p>
                    <center><img src="images/flux.png" width="300" style="mix-blend-mode: multiply;"></center>
                    Flux and luminosity are hence related according to the following relation $$F=\frac{L}{4\pi r^2}$$
                    Flux tells us how bright an object appears. The farther we go, the fainter a source appears.
                    <br> <b>Units of flux:</b> energy per unit area.
                    <h2 >Apparent & Absolute Magnitudes</h2>
                    <h3>Apparent Magnitude</h3>
                    <p>Human eyes are actually designed to percieve brightness logarithmically. It is therefore more convenient to have a logarithmic scale to measure brightness instead of a linear scale.</p>
                    <p>Hipparchus was a Greek astronomer in second century who catalogued stars visible to the naked eye. He divided stars into 6 categories based on their <b>apparent magnitudes (m)</b>. The apparent magnitude of \(m=1\) would be the brightest and \(m=6\) would be the faintest star.</p>
                    <p>Astronomers today use a similar scale even today! \(m=6\) is the limit of the naked eye. This is the faintest we can see without any aid. However, today, much fainter stars have been observed with telescopes.</p>
                    Relation between the flux (brightness) of two objects and their apparent magnitudes is:
                    $$m_1 -m_2 = 2.5 \log_{10} \frac{F_2}{F_1}$$
                    This scale is <b>defined</b> in such a way that a brightness difference of 100 corresponds to 5 magnitudes.
                    <p>So, a star of magnitude 1 is <br>
                    \(2.512\) times brighter than a star of magnitude 2<br>
                    \(2.512^2 = 6.3\) times brighter than a star of magnitude 3<br>
                    \(2.512^3 = 16\) times brighter than a star of magnitude 4<br>
                    \(2.512^4 = 40\) times brighter than a star of magnitude 5<br>
                    \(2.512^5 = 100\) times brighter than a star of magnitude 6<br><br>
                    As expected, the difference of 5 magnitude means a \(100\times\) difference in brightness.
                    <br><i>Note: Smaller magnitude => brighter object</i> 
                    <br><br>
                    <div class="example-box">
                        <b><i>Example:</i></b>
                        If we place another Sun along with our Sun, the brightness (flux) would be (nearly) 2 times.
                        <br> How much will be the apparent magnitude if the current apparent magnitude is \(m_\odot=4.83\)?<br>
                        <i><b>Solution:</b></i><br>
                        Since the flux is now twice the value, we have \(m_1 = m_\odot, \ m_2 = ? F_2 = 2F, \ F_1 = F\) we solve the following:
                        <br>
                        \[
                        \begin{align*}
                        m_1 - m_2 & = 2.5 \log_{10} \frac{F_2}{F_1} \\
                        m_\odot - m_2 & = 2.5 \log_{10} \frac{2F}{F} \\
                        4.83 - m_2 & = 2.5 \log_{10} 2 \\
                        m_2 & = 4.83 - 2.5 \log_{10} 2 \\
                        m_2 & = 4.07
                        \end{align*}
                        \]


                        &#8756 the apparent magnitude of two Suns would be 4.07. A smaller value since it would be brighter.<br>
                        The magnitude decrease of roughly 0.76 (i.e., 4.83-4.07) corresponds to doubling of the flux or brightness.
                    </div>
                    <h3>Absolute Magnitude</h3>
                    <p>Since apparent magnitude is related to the flux received, it does not tell us anything about the true brightness (luminosity). A faint star very close to us could easily appear brighter than a much brighter star which is far-far away.<br>
                    Wouldn't it be convenient if we could place all the stars on the equal footing?<br>
                    That's why we define the <b>absolute magnitude (M)</b> of a star.
                    This is the apparent magnitude of a star when it is placed \(10\) pc away from us.
                    <br>
                    This definition makes provides the formula:
                    $$m-M=2.5 \log{\frac{\frac{L}{4\pi r^2}}{\frac{L}{4\pi 10^2}}}$$
                        Note: \(r\) is in pc and L dosen't change (it's intrinsic, dosen't depend on the distance). Simplifying,
                        $$m-M=5\log{\frac{r}{10}}$$
                    </p>
                    Here, \(r\) is measured in pc.
                    <p>The interesting this to note is that this formula can be used to find the absolute magnitude of a source, when its distance is known. Distances can be known using the parallax
                        of a source which is relatively easy to measure. <br>
                        Conversely, if we know the absolute magnitude of a source (say it is a known type star), we can get a measure of its distance by simple comparing the apparent and absolute magnitudes using the above formula.
                    </p>

                    <h2 id="DistanceModulus">Distance Modulus</h2>
                    Having known the apparent and absolute magnitude of a star, we can infer how far it is from us. 
                    <br> 
                    $$m-M=5\log{\frac{r}{10}}$$
                    $$r = 10\times10^{(m-M)/5} \text{ pc}$$
                    <br>
                    Use the following calculators to find the distance to any star given its \(m\) and \(M\).
                <h3>r (distance) using m (apparent) and M (absolute) magnitudes</h3>
                <p>Enter the apparent magnitude \(m\) and absolute magnitude \(m\) to calculate \(r\)</p>

                    <h2>Stellar Parallax</h2>
                    <p>This is a basic and powerful method of finding distances to objects. It uses the knowledge of
                        easy high-school trigonometry. <br><br>
                        The scale of our Solar System was first comprehended in 1761 by measuring the distance to Venus.
                        This was done while it made a rare transit and crossed the disk of the Sun during inferior conjunction.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Let's see how this works. <br>
                        Consider two positions of an oberver observing a star at two different times from two different places as shown in the figure:
                        <center><img src="images/parllax.png" width="300" style="mix-blend-mode: multiply;"></center>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The two positions 1 and 2 are the extreme poisitons of the Earth's orbit around the Sun.
                        From simple trigonomery, we see that:
                        $$\tan{\theta} = \frac{r}{d}$$
                        for small angles \(\theta\) (which is the case for stars which are quite far indeed), \(\tan{\theta}=\theta\) 
                        $$\theta = \frac{r}{d}$$
                        This angle is known as the <i>parallax</i> of the star. Naturally, the farther the star, the smaller this angle \(\theta\).
                        <br>
                        This is denoted by sometimes by \(p\).
                        <br>
                        This is the angle that the souce shifts on the sky of the observer when the obeserver moves a distance \(r\)
                        <br>
                        Having known the parallax of a star, we immediately know the distance \(d\) to the star, since we already know what \(r\) is (it's \(1\text{AU}\)).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For example, consider the parallax of the nearest star to us <i>Proxima Centauri</i>. 
                        It has a parallax of 768 mas.<br>
                         (Note: mas = milliarcsecond = \(10^{-3}\) arcsecond = \(\frac{1}{3600\times 10^3}\)deg = \(\frac{\pi}{180\times3600\times 10^3}\)radian) <br>
                         which gives:<br>
                         \[
                         \begin{align*}
                             d & =  \frac{1 \text{ AU}}{768 \text{ mas}\times\frac{\pi}{180\times3600\times 10^3}} \\
                               & =  268574\text{ AU} \\
                               & =  4.03\times10^{16}\text{ m} \\
                               & =  1.3 \text{ pc}
                         \end{align*}
                         \]
                         <br>
                         The conversion of units can get a bit tedious. For this reason, we have the units of <b><i>parsec</i></b> which
                         make the converion from the standard unit of mas straightforward.
                    <h2>parsec (pc)</h2>
                    1 pc is \(3.086\times 10^{16}\)m. <br>
                    This arbitrary seeming distance is actually
                    the distance to a star which has a parallax of exactly 1 arcsecond.
                    <br>
                    Therefore, we have a simple conversion to get the distance <i>d</i> to a star as:
                    $$d = \frac{1}{p}$$
                    where <i>p</i> is the stellar parallax expressed in arcseconds.
                    <br>
                    We see that \(d = \frac{1}{768\times10^{-3}\text{as}} = \frac{1000}{768} \text{pc} = 1.3\) pc

                    <h2>Luminosity</h2>
                    <p><b>Luminosity</b> is the intrinsic brightness of an object. It is measured in the units of energy per time or <i>watts</i> (W)</p>
                    <p>For example, the Sun radiates \(4\times10^{26}\)W. Solar parameters are given special units. This amount of luminosity is called solar luminosity and is denoted by \(L_\odot\). $$L_\odot=4\times10^{26}\text{W}$$</p>
                    In astronomy, it is common to use cgs units. \(1\text{W} = 10^7\text{erg s}^{-1}\).
                    $$L_\odot=4\times10^{33}\text{erg s}^{-1}$$
                    The luminosity of our galaxy is about \(10^{11}L_\odot\)
                    <h2>Flux</h2>

                    The amount of radiation received by an observer who is at some distance away from the source of luminosity is the <b>flux</b> received by them.
                    <p>Naturally, this follows an inverse square law (see diagram below).</p>
                    <center><img src="images/flux.png" width="300" style="mix-blend-mode: multiply;"></center>
                    Flux and luminosity are hence related according to the following relation $$F=\frac{L}{4\pi r^2}$$
                    Flux tells us how bright an object appears. The farther we go, the fainter a source appears.
                    <br> <b>Units of flux:</b> energy per unit area.
                    <h2>Apparent & Absolute Magnitudes</h2>
                    <h3>Apparent Magnitude</h3>
                    <p>Human eyes are actually designed to percieve brightness logarithmically. It is therefore more convenient to have a logarithmic scale to measure brightness instead of a linear scale.</p>
                    <p>Hipparchus was a Greek astronomer in second century who catalogued stars visible to the naked eye. He divided stars into 6 categories based on their <b>apparent magnitudes (m)</b>. The apparent magnitude of \(m=1\) would be the brightest and \(m=6\) would be the faintest star.</p>
                    <p>Astronomers today use a similar scale even today! \(m=6\) is the limit of the naked eye. This is the faintest we can see without any aid. However, today, much fainter stars have been observed with telescopes.</p>
                    Relation between the flux (brightness) of two objects and their apparent magnitudes is:
                    $$m_1 -m_2 = 2.5 \log_{10} \frac{F_2}{F_1}$$
                    This scale is <b>defined</b> in such a way that a brightness difference of 100 corresponds to 5 magnitudes.
                    <p>So, a star of magnitude 1 is <br>
                    \(2.512\) times brighter than a star of magnitude 2<br>
                    \(2.512^2 = 6.3\) times brighter than a star of magnitude 3<br>
                    \(2.512^3 = 16\) times brighter than a star of magnitude 4<br>
                    \(2.512^4 = 40\) times brighter than a star of magnitude 5<br>
                    \(2.512^5 = 100\) times brighter than a star of magnitude 6<br><br>
                    As expected, the difference of 5 magnitude means a \(100\times\) difference in brightness.
                    <br><i>Note: Smaller magnitude => brighter object</i> 
                    <br><br>
                    <div class="example-box">
                        <b><i>Example:</i></b>
                        If we place another Sun along with our Sun, the brightness (flux) would be (nearly) 2 times.
                        <br> How much will be the apparent magnitude if the current apparent magnitude is \(m_\odot=4.83\)?<br>
                        <i><b>Solution:</b></i><br>
                        Since the flux is now twice the value, we have \(m_1 = m_\odot, \ m_2 = ? F_2 = 2F, \ F_1 = F\) we solve the following:
                        <br>
                        \[
                        \begin{align*}
                        m_1 - m_2 & = 2.5 \log_{10} \frac{F_2}{F_1} \\
                        m_\odot - m_2 & = 2.5 \log_{10} \frac{2F}{F} \\
                        4.83 - m_2 & = 2.5 \log_{10} 2 \\
                        m_2 & = 4.83 - 2.5 \log_{10} 2 \\
                        m_2 & = 4.07
                        \end{align*}
                        \]
                        &#8756 the apparent magnitude of two Suns would be 4.07. A smaller value since it would be brighter.<br>
                        The magnitude decrease of roughly 0.76 (i.e., 4.83-4.07) corresponds to doubling of the flux or brightness.
                    </div>
                    <h3>Absolute Magnitude</h3>
                    <p>Since apparent magnitude is related to the flux received, it does not tell us anything about the true brightness (luminosity). A faint star very close to us could easily appear brighter than a much brighter star which is far-far away.<br>
                    Wouldn't it be convenient if we could place all the stars on the equal footing?<br>
                    That's why we define the <b>absolute magnitude (M)</b> of a star.
                    This is the apparent magnitude of a star when it is placed \(10\) pc away from us.
                    <br>
                    This definition makes provides the formula:
                    $$m-M=2.5 \log{\frac{\frac{L}{4\pi r^2}}{\frac{L}{4\pi 10^2}}}$$
                        Note: \(r\) is in pc and L dosen't change (it's intrinsic, dosen't depend on the distance). Simplifying,
                        $$m-M=5\log{\frac{r}{10}}$$
                    </p>
                    Here, \(r\) is measured in pc.
                    <p>The interesting this to note is that this formula can be used to find the absolute magnitude of a source, when its distance is known. Distances can be known using the parallax
                        of a source which is relatively easy to measure. <br>
                        Conversely, if we know the absolute magnitude of a source (say it is a known type star), we can get a measure of its distance by simple comparing the apparent and absolute magnitudes using the above formula.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Distance Modulus</h2>
                    Having known the apparent and absolute magnitude of a star, we can infer how far it is from us. 
                    <br> 
                    $$m-M=5\log{\frac{r}{10}}$$
                    $$r = 10\times10^{(m-M)/5} \text{ pc}$$
                    <br>
                    Use the following calculators to find the distance to any star given its \(m\) and \(M\).
                <h3>r (distance) using m (apparent) and M (absolute) magnitudes</h3>
                <p>Enter the apparent magnitude \(m\) and absolute magnitude \(m\) to calculate \(r\)</p>

                    <p>All celestal objects move relative to each other. In addition, the Earth itself has its own motion. As a result, objects change their positions on the night sky. <br>
                    Objects which are closer like the Sun, Moon, planets in our solar system, commets etc. appear to move more noticeably. Star, galaxies etc. also do move, but their motion is not as apparent.
                    <br>
                    If we photograph the same area of the night sky over several years, we would find barely any differences in the positions of the stars.
                    <br>
                    These minute differences are however detectable by space-based telescopes such as Gaia.

                        </div> which is the 2D motion that is observed on the plane of the night sky. This is measured in angular units.</li>
                        This motion is very slow and is measured usually over an interval of 20-30 years. It is expressed in arc seconds per year by the symbol \(\mu\).
                        $$\mu = \frac{v_\theta}{r}$$ where \(v_\theta\) is the transverse velocity and \(r\) is the distance to the star.
                        <br> In these units, we have a useful relation for calculating the transverse velocity of stars:
                        $$v_\theta = 4.74 \mu r \text{  km/s}$$
                        Where \(v_\theta\) is in km/s, \(\mu\) is in arc seconds, and \(r\) is in parsec.
                        <br>With \(v_\theta\) and \(v_r\) known, we have the 3D velocity of the star:
                        $$v = \sqrt{v_\theta^2+v_r^2}$$
                    </ul>

                            <b><i>Example:</i></b>
                            The Barnard's star has the highest proper motion of all the known stars in the night sky.
                            <br>Find its 3D space velocity. You'll need its proper motion and distance. 
                            <br>
                            Deatails about the star can be found on <a href="http://simbad.cds.unistra.fr/simbad/sim-basic?Ident=barnard%27s+star&submit=SIMBAD+search"> SIMBAD</a>.
                        <br><br>
                        <b><i>Solution:</i></b>
                            <p>We see that two proper motion values are mentioned on the page. 
                                These are the proper motions along the 
                                <i>right ascension</i> \(\mu_{\alpha}^* = -801.551 \text{ mas}\) and along <i>declination</i>
                                \(\mu_{\delta}=10362.394 \text{ mas}\) </p>
                            <p>RA increases towards West <br> DE increases towards North</p>
                            <p>So, positive\(\mu_{\alpha}^*\) indicates motion towards West. Here it is negative so the star moves to the East (right).</p>
                            <p>Positive \(\mu_{\delta}\) indicates motion towards North. Here it is positive and hence the star moves to the North (upwards).</p>
                            Using these, we find the proper motion as: 
                            \[
                            \begin{align*}
                              \mu & = \sqrt{\mu_{\alpha}^{*2}+\mu_{\delta}^2} \\
                                  & =  \sqrt{-801.551^{2}+10362.394^2} \text{ mas} \\
                                  & =  10393.35 \text{ mas} \\
                                  & =  10.393 \text{ as} \\
                            \end{align*}
                            \]

                            We also have data on the parallax which gives us the distance. \(p=546.9759 \text{ mas}\). 
                            We can use our <a href="#" onclick="showContent('topic1', event)">calculator</a> to find that distance to the star \(r = 1.828 \text{ pc}\)
                            <br>
                            Now we use calculate the transverse velocity \(v_\theta\) as:
                            \[
                            \begin{align*}
                            v_\theta &= 4.74 \mu r \text{  km/s} \\
                            &= 4.74\times 10.393 \times 1.828 \text{  km/s} \\
                            &= 90.05 \text{  km/s}
                            \end{align*}
                            \]

                            Now, for the 3D space velocity, we get the radial velocity \(v_r = -110.11 \text{ km/s}\) from <a href="http://simbad.cds.unistra.fr/simbad/sim-basic?Ident=barnard%27s+star&submit=SIMBAD+search"> SIMBAD</a>:
                            (negative sign indicating a motion towards us)
                            \[
                            \begin{align*}
                            v &= \sqrt{v_\theta^2+v_r^2} \\
                            &= \sqrt{(90.05)^2+(-110.11)^2} \text{  km/s} \\
                            &= 142.24 \text{  km/s} \\
                            \end{align*}
                            \]

                    <p>The celestial north and south poles are above/below CNP, CSP; the origin of all 24 hours of Right Ascension (the measure of absolute celestial east–west position), the March equinox (center of the sun's position then) at the J2000 epoch, is vector V.
                        In red the diagram adds the components of proper motion across the celestial sphere.
                        An ideal time to measure exactly such a small annual shift is at culmination. The culmination of the star is daily reached when the observer (and earth) passes as shown by the blue arrows "beneath" the star.
                        The positive axes of the two components of its usually annually measured or published shift in proper motion are the exaggerated red arrows, note: the right arrows point to the east horizon. One red annotation is subtly shorter as the cosine of a star resting at 0° declination is 1, so such a star's east or west shift would not need to be multiplied by the cosine of its declination.
                        The proper motion vector is μ, α = right ascension, δ = declination, θ = position angle.</p>

                    <h2>Stellar Parallax</h2>
                    <p>This is a basic and powerful method of finding distances to objects. It uses the knowledge of
                        easy high-school trigonometry. <br><br>
                        The scale of our Solar System was first comprehended in 1761 by measuring the distance to Venus.
                        This was done while it made a rare transit and crossed the disk of the Sun during inferior conjunction.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Let's see how this works. <br>
                        Consider two positions of an oberver observing a star at two different times from two different places as shown in the figure:
                        <center><img src="images/parllax.png" width="300" style="mix-blend-mode: multiply;"></center>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The two positions 1 and 2 are the extreme poisitons of the Earth's orbit around the Sun.
                        From simple trigonomery, we see that:
                        $$\tan{\theta} = \frac{r}{d}$$
                        for small angles \(\theta\) (which is the case for stars which are quite far indeed), \(\tan{\theta}=\theta\) 
                        $$\theta = \frac{r}{d}$$
                        This angle is known as the <i>parallax</i> of the star. Naturally, the farther the star, the smaller this angle \(\theta\).
                        <br>
                        This is denotes by sometimes by \(p\).
                        <br>
                        Having known the parallax of a star, we immediately know the distance \(d\) to the star, since we already know what \(r\) is (it's \(1\text{AU}\)).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For example, consider the parallax of the nearest star to us <i>Proxima Centauri</i>. 
                        It has a parallax of 768 mas.<br>
                         (Note: mas = milliarcsecond = \(10^{-3}\) arcsecond = \(\frac{1}{3600\times 10^3}\)deg = \(\frac{\pi}{180\times3600\times 10^3}\)radian) <br>
                         which gives:<br>
                         \[
                         \begin{align*}
                             d & =  \frac{1 \text{ AU}}{768 \text{ mas}\times\frac{\pi}{180\times3600\times 10^3}} \\
                               & =  268574\text{ AU} \\
                               & =  4.03\times10^{16}\text{ m} \\
                               & =  1.3 \text{ pc}
                         \end{align*}
                         \]
                         <br>
                         The conversion of units can get a bit tedious. For this reason, we have the units of <b><i>parsec</i></b> which
                         make the converion from the standard unit of mas straightforward.
                    <h2>parsec (pc)</h2>
                    1 pc is \(3.086\times 10^{16}\)m. <br>
                    This arbitrary seeming distance is actually
                    the distance to a star which has a parallax of exactly 1 arcsecond.
                    <br>
                    Therefore, we have a simple conversion to get the distance <i>d</i> to a star as:
                    $$d = \frac{1}{p}$$
                    where <i>p</i> is the stellar parallax expressed in arcseconds.
                    <br>
                    We see that \(d = \frac{1}{768\times10^{-3}\text{as}} = \frac{1000}{768} \text{pc} = 1.3\) pc

                    <h2>Luminosity</h2>
                    <p><b>Luminosity</b> is the intrinsic brightness of an object. It is measured in the units of energy per time or <i>watts</i> (W)</p>
                    <p>For example, the Sun radiates \(4\times10^{26}\)W. Solar parameters are given special units. This amount of luminosity is called solar luminosity and is denoted by \(L_\odot\). $$L_\odot=4\times10^{26}\text{W}$$</p>
                    In astronomy, it is common to use cgs units. \(1\text{W} = 10^7\text{erg s}^{-1}\).
                    $$L_\odot=4\times10^{33}\text{erg s}^{-1}$$
                    The luminosity of our galaxy is about \(10^{11}L_\odot\)
                    <h2>Flux</h2>

                    The amount of radiation received by an observer who is at some distance away from the source of luminosity is the <b>flux</b> received by them.
                    <p>Naturally, this follows an inverse square law (see diagram below).</p>
                    <center><img src="images/flux.png" width="300" style="mix-blend-mode: multiply;"></center>
                    Flux and luminosity are hence related according to the following relation $$F=\frac{L}{4\pi r^2}$$
                    Flux tells us how bright an object appears. The farther we go, the fainter a source appears.
                    <h2>Apparent & Absolute Magnitudes</h2>
                    <p>Human eyes are actually designed to percieve brightness logarithmically. It is therefore more convenient to have a logarithmic scale to measure brightness instead of a linear scale.</p>
                    <p>Hipparchus was a Greek astronomer in second century who catalogued stars visible to the naked eye. He divided stars into 6 categories based on their <b>apparent magnitudes (m)</b>. The apparent magnitude of \(m=1\) would be the brightest and \(m=6\) would be the faintest star.</p>
                    <p>Astronomers today use a similar scale even today! \(m=6\) is the limit of the naked eye. This is the faintest we can see without any aid. However, today, much fainter stars have been observed with telescopes.</p>
                    Relation between the flux (brightness) of two objects and their apparent magnitudes is:
                    $$m_1 -m_2 = 2.5 \log_{10} \frac{F_2}{F_1}$$
                    This scale is <b>defined</b> in such a way that a brightness difference of 100 corresponds to 5 magnitudes.
                    <p>So, a star of magnitude 1 is <br>
                    \(2.512\) times brighter than a star of magnitude 2<br>
                    \(2.512^2 = 6.3\) times brighter than a star of magnitude 3<br>
                    \(2.512^3 = 16\) times brighter than a star of magnitude 4<br>
                    \(2.512^4 = 40\) times brighter than a star of magnitude 5<br>
                    \(2.512^5 = 100\) times brighter than a star of magnitude 6<br><br>
                    As expected, the difference of 5 magnitude means a \(100\times\) difference in brightness.
                    <br><i>Note: Smaller magnitude => brighter object</i> 
                    <p>Since apparent magnitude is related to the flux received, it does not tell us anything about the true brightness (luminosity). A faint star very close to us could easily appear brighter than a much brighter star which is far-far away.<br>
                    Wouldn't it be convenient if we could place all the stars on the equal footing?<br>
                    That's why we define the <b>absolute magnitude (M)</b> of a star.
                    This is the apparent magnitude of a star when it is placed \(10\) pc away from us.
                    <br>
                    This definition makes provides the formula:
                    $$m-M=2.5 \log{\frac{\frac{L}{4\pi r^2}}{\frac{L}{4\pi 10^2}}}$$
                        Note: \(r\) is in pc and L dosen't change (it's intrinsic, dosen't depend on the distance). Simplifying,
                        $$m-M=5\log{\frac{r}{10}}$$
                    </p>
                    Here, \(r\) is measured in pc.
                    <p>The interesting this to note is that this formula can be used to find the absolute magnitude of a source, when its distance is known. Distances can be known using the parallax
                        of a source which is relatively easy to measure. <br>
                        Conversely, if we know the absolute magnitude of a source (say it is a known type star), we can get a measure of its distance by simple comparing the apparent and absolute magnitudes using the above formula.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Distance Modulus</h2>
                    Having known the apparent and absolute magnitude of a star, we can infer how far it is from us. <br> Use the following calculators to find the distance to any star given its \(m\) and \(M\).
                <h3>r (distance) using m (apparent) and M (absolute) magnitudes</h3>
                <p>Enter the apparent magnitude \(m\) and absolute magnitude \(m\)</p>

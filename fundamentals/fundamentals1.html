                    <h2>Stellar Parallax</h2>
                    <p>This is a basic and powerful method of finding distances to objects. It uses the knowledge of
                        easy high-school trigonometry. <br><br>
                        The scale of our Solar System was first comprehended in 1761 by measuring the distance to Venus.
                        This was done while it made a rare transit and crossed the disk of the Sun during inferior conjunction.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Let's see how this works. <br>
                        Consider two positions of an oberver observing a star at two different times from two different places as shown in the figure:
                        <center><img src="images/parllax.png" width="300" style="mix-blend-mode: multiply;"></center>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The two positions 1 and 2 are the extreme poisitons of the Earth's orbit around the Sun.
                        From simple trigonomery, we see that:
                        $$\tan{\theta} = \frac{r}{d}$$
                        for small angles \(\theta\) (which is the case for stars which are quite far indeed), \(\tan{\theta}=\theta\) 
                        $$\theta = \frac{r}{d}$$
                        This angle is known as the <i>parallax</i> of the star. Naturally, the farther the star, the smaller this angle \(\theta\).
                        <br>
                        This is denoted by sometimes by \(p\).
                        <br>
                        This is the angle that the souce shifts on the sky of the observer when the obeserver moves a distance \(r\)
                        <br>
                        Having known the parallax of a star, we immediately know the distance \(d\) to the star, since we already know what \(r\) is (it's \(1\text{AU}\)).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For example, consider the parallax of the nearest star to us <i>Proxima Centauri</i>. 
                        It has a parallax of 768 mas.<br>
                         (Note: mas = milliarcsecond = \(10^{-3}\) arcsecond = \(\frac{1}{3600\times 10^3}\)deg = \(\frac{\pi}{180\times3600\times 10^3}\)radian) <br>
                         which gives:<br>
                         \[
                         \begin{align*}
                             d & =  \frac{1 \text{ AU}}{768 \text{ mas}\times\frac{\pi}{180\times3600\times 10^3}} \\
                               & =  268574\text{ AU} \\
                               & =  4.03\times10^{16}\text{ m} \\
                               & =  1.3 \text{ pc}
                         \end{align*}
                         \]
                         <br>
                         The conversion of units can get a bit tedious. For this reason, we have the units of <b><i>parsec</i></b> which
                         make the converion from the standard unit of mas straightforward.
                    <h2>parsec (pc)</h2>
                    1 pc is \(3.086\times 10^{16}\)m. <br>
                    This arbitrary seeming distance is actually
                    the distance to a star which has a parallax of exactly 1 arcsecond.
                    <br>
                    Therefore, we have a simple conversion to get the distance <i>d</i> to a star as:
                    $$d = \frac{1}{p}$$
                    where <i>p</i> is the stellar parallax expressed in arcseconds.
                    <br>
                    We see that \(d = \frac{1}{768\times10^{-3}\text{as}} = \frac{1000}{768} \text{pc} = 1.3\) pc
